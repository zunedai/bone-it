# Bone it!
This plugin helps to create a complex rig for tentacles and tails using a single armature bone. At the moment, it only names, subdivides bones, does parenting and unparenting and creates tweakers and constraints.


To install, open blender and go to Edit > Preferences, click the Add-ons tab, click Install, navigate to where you downloaded the file,  click Install Add-on and tick the box to activate it

To use the plugin, create a new bone in an armature and select the middle of the bone. In the UI to the right, you will see a tab named Bone It! Click the tab. Enter your desired name for the bones (WARNING: Currently renames armature. Use with caution!) and how many bones you want to create. Then, click the Bone It! button. Once done, click Tweak It! to create tweaker bones, do parenting and create stretch-to constraints.
